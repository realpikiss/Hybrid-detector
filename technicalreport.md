## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Software vulnerabilities pose an escalating threat to cybersecurity infrastructure, with over 90,000 documented vulnerabilities now affecting critical systems worldwide. The exponential growth in software complexity, coupled with increasingly sophisticated attack vectors, necessitates robust automated vulnerability detection solutions capable of operating at scale while maintaining exceptional accuracy.

Current vulnerability detection approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural limitation: they typically operate in isolation, relying either purely on structural patterns captured through static analysis or on semantic understanding derived from language models. This mono-modal approach creates critical gaps in detection capability. Structural methods excel at identifying recurring patterns but **miss context-dependent vulnerabilities** where the same code construct may be safe or vulnerable depending on surrounding conditions. Conversely, semantic methods provide rich contextual understanding but **lack the precise pattern recognition** essential for systematic vulnerability identification.

The VulRAG approach introduced by Du et al. (2024) demonstrated the transformative potential of retrieval-augmented generation for vulnerability detection. However, this methodology operates exclusively in the semantic domain, overlooking valuable opportunities to leverage structural similarities that could significantly enhance retrieval quality and detection accuracy.

### 1.1.1 Research Hypothesis

We hypothesize that  **neither semantic similarities alone nor structural similarities alone are sufficient to comprehensively identify similar vulnerability patterns** . This limitation manifests in two critical scenarios:

 **Example 1 - Structural Limitation** : Consider two functions where one performs secure string copying using `strncpy` with proper bounds checking, while another uses the same API but contains a subtle off-by-one error in the length calculation. Pure structural analysis would identify these as highly similar due to identical API usage patterns, potentially missing the critical logical vulnerability in the bounds calculation.

 **Example 2 - Semantic Limitation** : Consider a buffer overflow vulnerability in a network packet parser versus a similar overflow in a file format parser. While both involve improper input validation leading to memory corruption, their semantic descriptions may focus on different domains (networking vs. file processing), causing semantic-only retrieval to miss the underlying structural similarity in their vulnerability patterns.

Our hypothesis suggests that **combining both structural and semantic analysis** will capture vulnerability patterns that either approach would miss in isolation, leading to improved detection coverage and accuracy.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research addresses these limitations through the following objectives:

1. **Develop a unified hybrid approach** that seamlessly integrates structural Code Property Graph (CPG) analysis with semantic understanding through large language models
2. **Evaluate the effectiveness** of structural pre-filtering in enhancing retrieval quality for RAG-based vulnerability detection systems
3. **Conduct comprehensive performance analysis** across multiple detection methodologies using standardized benchmarks
4. **Analyze the fundamental trade-offs** between precision, recall, and computational efficiency in hybrid detection systems

### 1.3 Contributions

Our research delivers several key contributions to the vulnerability detection domain:

* **Novel hybrid architecture** that combines CPG structural pre-filtering with multi-field semantic re-ranking in an integrated pipeline
* **Comprehensive evaluation framework** enabling systematic comparison across four distinct detection approaches
* **Empirical analysis** of structural-semantic integration benefits in real-world vulnerability detection scenarios
* **Open-source implementation** facilitating reproducible research and practical deployment in production environments

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Structural Vulnerability Detection

The foundation of structural vulnerability detection was established by Yamaguchi et al. (2014) through their introduction of  **Code Property Graphs (CPGs)** . This groundbreaking approach unified Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Control Flow Graphs (CFG), and Program Dependence Graphs (PDG) into a comprehensive representation capable of capturing both syntactic structure and semantic dependencies. The effectiveness of this methodology was demonstrated through the discovery of 88 vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, including 18 previously unknown cases.

Building upon this foundation, subsequent research has extended CPG-based analysis through machine learning integration. **Devign** (Zhou et al., 2019) pioneered the application of Graph Neural Networks to CPG representations, while **HiddenCPG** (Wi et al., 2022) introduced sophisticated techniques for learning hidden structural patterns within code graphs. Despite these advances, purely structural approaches remain constrained by their inability to capture semantic context and their dependence on substantial training datasets for effective pattern recognition.

### 2.2 Large Language Models for Vulnerability Detection

The emergence of large language models has fundamentally transformed code analysis capabilities, ushering in new possibilities for vulnerability detection. Advanced models such as **GPT-4** and **DeepSeek-Coder** demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding code semantics and can identify complex vulnerability patterns through sophisticated natural language reasoning. However, their systematic application to vulnerability detection encounters significant practical challenges.

**Direct LLM analysis** faces inherent limitations in consistency and cost-effectiveness. While these models excel at identifying obvious vulnerabilities in isolated code snippets, they struggle with subtle context-dependent issues that require understanding of broader program context. Furthermore, the token-by-token analysis of large codebases becomes prohibitively expensive for practical deployment scenarios.

**Fine-tuning approaches** attempt to address these limitations by specializing LLMs for vulnerability detection tasks. However, these methods demand substantial computational resources and carefully curated domain-specific datasets. Research by Zhou et al. (2024) reveals that 73% of recent studies rely on fine-tuning methodologies, yet this approach suffers from inflexibility when encountering novel vulnerability types or divergent coding patterns.

 **Prompt engineering emerges as a promising middle ground** , enabling researchers to guide LLM analysis through carefully crafted instructions without the computational overhead of fine-tuning. Studies demonstrate that well-designed prompts can significantly enhance vulnerability detection accuracy by providing explicit security-focused instructions and contextual examples.

However, effective prompt engineering demands **deep domain expertise** spanning both cybersecurity principles and specific codebase characteristics. Security experts must manually encode their knowledge into prompts, including comprehensive understanding of vulnerability patterns, attack vectors, and context-dependent security implications. This requirement creates significant scalability barriers, as each new vulnerability type or domain may necessitate extensive prompt redesign by experts who possess both technical depth and broad security context.

The **manual nature of prompt engineering** further constrains adaptability. Prompts optimized for buffer overflow detection may prove ineffective for race condition vulnerabilities, requiring separate expertise and development cycles. As new vulnerability patterns emerge, the prompt engineering process must be continuously repeated, making comprehensive coverage across evolving threat landscapes increasingly challenging. This is precisely where Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a compelling solution.

### 2.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Vulnerability Detection

**RAG addresses these fundamental limitations** by combining pre-trained language models with dynamic knowledge retrieval capabilities, enabling models to access relevant vulnerability examples without the computational costs of fine-tuning or the manual overhead of expert prompt engineering. The **economic advantages are substantial** – RAG approaches reduce operational costs by 60-80% compared to fine-tuning while maintaining adaptability through straightforward knowledge base updates.

**VulRAG** (Du et al., 2024) pioneered this approach for vulnerability detection, achieving impressive 16-24% accuracy improvements by retrieving similar vulnerable code examples to provide contextual grounding for LLM analysis. This methodology demonstrated the transformative potential of retrieval-augmented approaches in security applications.

However,  **the VulRAG approach operates exclusively in the semantic domain** , employing text-based similarity search (BM25) across code descriptions and vulnerable examples. While effective within its scope, this approach exhibits  **critical limitations** : (1) **Semantic noise** – lexically similar but structurally distinct code may be retrieved, introducing irrelevant context; (2) **Missing structural patterns** – vulnerability detection frequently depends on structural code patterns that text-based retrieval cannot effectively capture; (3) **Retrieval quality bottlenecks** – without structural guidance, semantic search may consistently miss the most relevant examples, directly degrading detection performance.

This analysis reveals the need for more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms that strategically combine both structural and semantic similarity, precisely the gap our hybrid approach aims to address.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Overall Pipeline

Our hybrid system implements an innovative three-stage pipeline that synergistically combines structural and semantic analysis methodologies:

    (CPG)      (FAISS Top-10)          (BM25+RRF Top-3)    (Contextual)
```

This architecture strategically addresses the limitations of mono-modal approaches through:

* **Intelligent search space reduction** via structural similarity matching

This multi-layered representation captures both explicit syntactic structure and implicit semantic dependencies essential for comprehensive vulnerability analysis.

 **Feature Extraction** : A carefully designed 25-dimensional feature vector is systematically extracted from each CPG, encompassing:

* Graph topology metrics (nodes, edges, density, degree distribution)
* Control flow complexity indicators (cyclomatic complexity, loop structures, conditional branching)
* CWE-categorized dangerous function call patterns
* Memory operation signatures and patterns
* Data flow relationship quantification

 **Similarity Search** : Extracted features are efficiently indexed using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) with L2 distance metrics, enabling rapid nearest-neighbor retrieval of structurally analogous functions from large code repositories.

#### 3.2.2 Semantic Analysis Module

 **Multi-field Retrieval** : A sophisticated BM25-based retrieval system operates across three complementary semantic dimensions:

* `code`: Raw vulnerable source code for direct pattern matching
* `purpose`: LLM-generated functional summaries (1-2 sentences) capturing high-level intent
* `behavior`: Detailed step-by-step operational descriptions revealing execution patterns

 **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** : Results from multiple semantic fields are intelligently combined using RRF with a carefully calibrated smoothing parameter (k=60), providing robust score aggregation across diverse semantic dimensions while minimizing field-specific biases.

#### 3.2.3 LLM Analysis Module

 **Iterative Detection** : The system orchestrates multiple sophisticated analysis passes:

1. **Direct Analysis** : Baseline vulnerability assessment without external context
2. **Contextual Analysis** : Enhanced assessment leveraging retrieved similar examples
3. **Intelligent Aggregation** : Weighted voting across multiple analytical iterations

 **Robust Parsing** : Multiple parsing strategies ensure reliable handling of LLM response variations, incorporating keyword matching, pattern-based fallbacks, and confidence extraction mechanisms for consistent result interpretation.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Hybrid Approach Benefits

 **Enhanced Recall Achievement** : The strategic integration of structural pre-filtering with semantic re-ranking yielded the highest recall (48.0%) among all tested approaches. This improvement suggests that structural guidance effectively identifies relevant semantic patterns that pure semantic search methodologies consistently miss, representing a fundamental advancement in retrieval quality.

 **Optimal Performance Balance** : The hybrid approach achieved the superior F1-score (0.565), indicating an optimal equilibrium between precision and recall that proves particularly valuable for practical deployment scenarios where both false positives and false negatives carry significant operational costs.

 **Computational Efficiency Gains** : Structural pre-filtering dramatically reduces the semantic search space from thousands of candidates to manageable sets of tens, delivering significant computational efficiency improvements while maintaining or enhancing detection quality—a crucial advantage for large-scale deployment scenarios.

### 7.2 Structural Pre-filtering Impact

 **Dramatic Search Space Reduction** : The implemented two-stage retrieval process (structural → semantic) achieves approximately 99% candidate space reduction, efficiently narrowing from ~2,300 knowledge base entries to 10 structural candidates to 3 final candidates for LLM analysis.

 **Retrieval Quality Enhancement** : Structural filtering demonstrably biases semantic retrieval toward more relevant examples, as evidenced by improved recall performance compared to semantic-only approaches. This suggests that structural similarity provides valuable guidance for semantic search processes.

 **System Robustness** : The structural component establishes a stable analytical foundation that proves less sensitive to lexical variations and coding style differences, enhancing overall system reliability across diverse codebases.

### 7.3 Practical Implications

 **Industrial Deployment Viability** : The achieved 68.6% precision rate indicates that approximately 7 out of 10 flagged vulnerabilities represent genuine security concerns, establishing a reasonable false positive rate acceptable for security-critical applications requiring manual verification processes.

 **Security Team Efficiency** : The substantial recall rate (48.0%) ensures detection of the majority of identifiable vulnerabilities, providing comprehensive support for security auditing workflows and risk assessment procedures.

 **Cost-Benefit Optimization** : The hybrid approach successfully balances detection coverage with computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for continuous integration pipelines and large-scale automated code analysis systems.

## 8. Limitations and Future Work

* **Structural Only** achieved merely 28.0% recall, confirming that structural patterns miss numerous semantically complex vulnerabilities
* **VulRAG (semantic only)** reached 46.0% recall, demonstrating that semantic analysis alone leaves significant gaps in detection coverage
* **Structural VulRAG (hybrid)** achieved the highest recall at 48.0% and best F1-score (56.5%), validating that combining both approaches captures vulnerability patterns that either method misses in isolation

 **Future Potential** : The demonstrated improvements suggest that **continuing research in this hybrid scope holds substantial potential** for advancing vulnerability detection capabilities. The synergistic combination of structural and semantic analysis represents a promising paradigm that could be further enhanced through advanced machine learning techniques, expanded knowledge bases, and cross-language generalization.

The comprehensive results demonstrate that structural-semantic integration offers measurable and meaningful advantages over purely structural or semantic approaches, suggesting highly promising directions for developing next-generation vulnerability detection tools. While current limitations include dataset scope constraints and binary classification boundaries, the modular system architecture provides an excellent foundation for addressing these challenges through systematic future enhancements.

Our open-source implementation is available at [here](https://github.com/realpikiss/Hybrid-detector), facilitating reproducible research and practical deployment while contributing valuable resources to the broader cybersecurity community's ongoing efforts to develop effective, scalable vulnerability detection solutions for increasingly complex software environments.
